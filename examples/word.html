            <p>We are a group of investors whose visions converged in building and establishing an economic holding group - since 2016,
                keeping pace with the movement of economic development globally and regionally, and through the accumulated experience enjoyed by the founders of the group globally,
                regionally and locally, spanning nearly 50 years in the sectors of economics, investment, information technology, trade, economic studies and management. Industrial sectors, energy, mining activities and supply chain systems.
                We are honored that the founders of the group are an elite group of visionaries and intellectuals with academic and professional experience They have held many sovereign and executive positions globally, regionally and locally
                 in a number of global and local forums, which qualifies the Arab Holding Group for Sustainable Investment to assume a great position among the emerging economic entities locally and regionally within 10 years through a strategic vision that keeps pace with the requirements of the global market in the third millennium, and so on. The group is able to build an economic entity capable of continuity and growth through rational management of all stages of work in the group and its multi-activity companies by separating ownership from aspirations.
                Management in all activities of the group companies through the use of local and international expertise and building a work team that will be a partner in creating success</p>
            <p>It achieves belonging and development through skills refining programs in accordance with the highest standards of human resource capacity building, out of the group’s belief that the basic foundation for the success of institutions is the human element.
                Through the group's approach to scientific and professional preparation of economic feasibility studies to study the markets and activities that the group aspires to penetrate, we had a specific vision and strategy | The volume of demand for the services and products of the group’s companies’ activities keeps pace globally and regionally, and we cannot ignore the group’s role in achieving the highest standards of environmental sustainability in order to fulfill the active responsibility of economic entities to reduce emissions and reduce environmental risks. This was evident in all of our projects from the stage of interoperable design and implementation using raw materials. Environmentally friendly and building a system of rationalizing consumption and recycling resources to reduce the depletion of natural resources and reduce harmful emissions. The group’s social responsibility programs will become a global icon to be emulated globally through programs that are compatible with the needs of the local community for each of the group’s activity sites, as the social responsibility programs are appropriate to the demographic composition and societal needs. For each region, through an analytical study of all the requirements and needs of the local community, the group is certain that achieving the group’s goals will not come without a local community that is compatible and coexisting with our activities, which guarantees our projects the community backing for the success and continuity of our activities</p>
